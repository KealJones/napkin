# Concept games and chess

- [ ] Add reusable collection, record, geometry, and persistent-state Concepts.
- [ ] Seed chess movement, legality, transitions, outcomes, and evaluation as composed realizations.
- [ ] Add game sessions, action matching, simulation, corrections, and consent-controlled rule changes.
- [ ] Connect the game interaction to chat through Concepts and expose the expressions for inspection.
- [ ] Test ordinary play, illegal/ambiguous requests, special moves, variants, persistence, and actual chat use.
- [ ] Run workspace checks and document usage and remaining limits.

Domain behavior belongs in the saved Concept units. Seed files author ordinary units; no chess dispatch is added to the evaluator. Host code is limited to reusable operations on values, collections, geometry, storage, and external model transport.

# Ideas

- [ ] Types as Claims, written as TypeScript: kinds carried as `claim=` on binding sites (no wrapper), author annotations kept, a `Claim` Concept infers the rest, interfaces/aliases as `Kind(...)`, cross-file kinds resolved for inference. Plan: `tasks/typescript-claims.md`.
